## Introduction

 
### This script will help automate creation of new user accounts. I have used this script on Centos 8. 
There are three files available:
* onboarding user - main bash script to create the user.
* newuser - list of users.
* deluser - to delete users, this is optional.

Before running the scripts you must provide permission to run the script:
```
chmod +x newuser.sh
```
\
**Onboarding user**
###
The script is aimed to read the newuser.csv file, print the user name and go throug ha automation process using for loops and if statements to create the user accounts, apply the appropriate permissions for the .ssh folders and the private and public keys which are required to ssh.

The following permission has been set for the relevant files and folders[(Permission reference)](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/ssh1.html):
* ~/.ssh/ - 700
* ~/.ssh/authorized_keys - 600
* ~/.ssh/id_rsa - 600
* ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - 644

The aim of the script is also to allow SSH access from localhost and also from my local machine.
* The public key -authenticated_keys needs the local machine hostname added.

**deluser**

###
This will use the same csv file to delete, you can amend the file or provide a new file name within the code.


### FYI - Secrets/Private key & Public Key
* secrets.id_rsa - my private key for SSH
* secrets.id_rsa.pub - my public key for SSH


## Run script

```sh
/onboarding users
```


## Usage

### To delete created users
```
/delusers
```
